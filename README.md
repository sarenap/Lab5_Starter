1. I would not use only a unit test to test the message feature.
Unit test is more for logic in 1 part of code. The message sending depends
on more outside factors in the application/feature level.
2. yes I would use unit testing for "max message length". It simply checks
the length of a message which should not depend on many application/feature level.
